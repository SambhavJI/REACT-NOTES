We can create custom hooks in react for diffrent functions. It should be kept inside the utils folder.
Chunking or code spliting or lazy loading is a way to split you code into diffrent chunks to make it easy to load.
lazy loading means a component will initially not load any code of the component only when its needed then only react will load its component making the work for browser less.
This is done by importing it via react function called lazy which takes a callback function which takes the function import so that the function is not loaded until needed.
The component which is lazy loaded takes time to run but react is fast and it tries to render the component which throws an error that is why we use <suspence> tag provided by react which can wrap the component so react does not throw an error.It also takes a fallback which is used to display any component while the lazy load component is loading.
