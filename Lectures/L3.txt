Here in the app.js we use react to create an element by the function create element which takes first argument as the tag which you want and then the second argument as the parameters of the tag like id etc and the third as the text for the tag. now to display it in out index.html file we need to get the root from the index.html file where we need our tag to be via the reactDOM.createroot function . And finally we will do root.render to display.
As create element is not a good way to create an element so we use the jsx which is javascript like syntax and create element using it which is easier. Both createElement and jsx i same but the syntax for jsx is easier.
JSX is transpiled into browser understandable code through parcel and more precisely a package inside parcel called babel. The jsx code is converted to createElement then into JSboject and the finally HTML via babel and parcel.
React Component - There are two ways to make components i.e class component and function component.Component is a normal JS function which returns a JSX. Write the component name starting with a capital letter. And to render a component use angular brackets inside root.render.
To call another component inside another component we will use the function name inside angular bracket which is called component composition.
To get a react element inside a component use curly braces on the name of the component.
